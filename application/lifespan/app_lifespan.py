"""
This module provides an asynchronous context manager for managing the lifespan.

The main functionality of this module is provided by the function `lifespan`,
which handles the application startup and shutdown stages.
The `startup_all` method from the handlers is called before entering
the context, followed by the `shutdown_all` method after leaving
the context.

The module utilizes the `asynccontextmanager` decorator from the contextlib,
and involves the handlers module from the package
`application.lifespan.handler_collections.handler_group`.

Modules:
--------
contextlib: For creating an asynchronous context manager.
typing: Provides type hints compatibility.
fastapi.FastAPI: Framework for building APIs.
application.lifespan.handler_collections.handler_group.handlers:
For application startup and shutdown handlers.

Functions:
----------
async def lifespan(_app: FastAPI) -> None:
    Context manager used to handle the application lifespan.

    Yields:
        This context manager does not yield any value.
        However, the use of 'yield' serves to mark the
        context of the application lifespan, with setup
        on entrance (before yield) and shutdown procedures
        on exit (after yield).
